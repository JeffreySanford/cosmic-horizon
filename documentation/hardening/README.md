# Hardening Documentation

This folder collects materials related to the security, operational, and
quality hardening effort for the Cosmic Horizons platform.  The primary
artefact is the hardening plan itself, which lives at
`HARDENING-PLAN.md` and is kept up to date as phases are executed.

## Contents

- `HARDENING-PLAN.md` – step‑by‑step checklist covering Phases 0 through 8.

## Usage

- Review the plan during design/PR reviews to ensure compliance with agreed
  hardening objectives.
- Reference the plan when preparing release notes or operational runbooks.
- Generate the docs catalog (see `npm run docs:view:build`) after placing
  new materials here; the hardening plan is already included.
