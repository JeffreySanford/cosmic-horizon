# Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

This document will eventually contain a rendered diagram representing the current
PostgreSQL schema. For now it serves as a placeholder and reminder to maintain
an up-to-date ERD as new entities or migrations are added.

- generated with [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io) or similar tool.
- export should live in `documentation/database/ERD.png` or `.svg` alongside this
  markdown.
