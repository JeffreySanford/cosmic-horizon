# Abstract Follow-Up Template

Subject: `Cosmic Horizons 2026 abstract follow-up: vlass-portal infrastructure track`

Hello [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my submitted abstract:
`vlass-portal: A Web-Native Operational Interface for AI-Driven VLASS Data Exploration and Analysis Aligned with CosmicAI and ngVLA Infrastructure`.

The submission is framed as research software infrastructure that complements model and compute work with:
- operational workflow UX
- reproducibility and auditability
- role-aware orchestration for AI-assisted analysis

If there is a preferred track/session for infrastructure-focused contributions, I would appreciate guidance.

Thank you,
