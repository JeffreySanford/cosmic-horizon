# Who To Contact For Proposal Positioning

Status date: 2026-02-10

Treat this as a research software/infrastructure proposal, not a pure theory proposal.

## Priority Order

1. CosmicAI leadership (`Director`, `Program Manager`, `Operations Lead`)
2. Observable/operations-oriented working-group leads (especially NRAO-aligned leads)
3. Research software and cyberinfrastructure leads (NRAO/TACC/UVA ecosystem)
4. Conference organizer inbox (submission logistics only)

## Why This Order

- Leadership and WG leads assess strategic fit.
- Research software leads validate operational usefulness.
- Organizers validate deadlines/format, not intellectual direction.

## Positioning Statement

`vlass-portal` is a web-native operational interface for AI-driven radio astronomy pipelines, intended to complement CosmicAI/NRAO backend compute with workflow orchestration, reproducibility, and human-facing domain UX.

## Contact Checklist

- Include a one-sentence project definition.
- Include proof of shipped pillars (SSR, Aladin workflows, revisioned notebooks).
- Ask for fit validation, not approval.
- Include repo link and optional demo link.
