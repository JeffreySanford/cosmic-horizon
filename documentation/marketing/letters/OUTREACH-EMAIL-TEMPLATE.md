Subject: `vlass-portal: operational web interface for CosmicAI/ngVLA workflows (Cosmic Horizons 2026)`

Hello [Name],

I am a research software engineer working on `vlass-portal`, an open-source web-native operations interface for VLASS workflows (`github.com/JeffreySanford/vlass-portal`).

We recently shipped three platform pillars:
- SSR fast first paint for responsive access
- Aladin viewer integration with permalink/snapshot workflows
- Notebook-style posts with revision history for reproducible collaboration

Based on CosmicAI and Cosmic Horizons priorities, I believe this aligns as a research software infrastructure contribution: an operational UX/control-plane layer for AI-driven radio pipelines (calibration, reconstruction, anomaly detection), complementary to backend compute ecosystems.

I plan to submit a poster/short-talk abstract for Cosmic Horizons 2026 and wanted to sanity-check that this infrastructure framing fits the program direction.

If useful, I can share a short live demo.

Best,
